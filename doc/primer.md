## ZCTAs vs ZIP Codes: A Primer

### ZIP Codes

* Used for mail delivery
* Not polygons
* Polygon ZIP codes, where they exist, are unofficial and not consistent

### ZCTAS

* Used for statistical analysis and mapping
* Polygons based on US Census Bureau boundaries (tabulation blocks)
* Official and released every 10 years by the US Census Bureau

### [From the US Census Bureau:](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/guidance/geo-areas/zctas.html)

>ZIP Code Tabulation Areas or ZCTAs (pronounced zik-tahs) are a geographic product of the U.S. Census Bureau created to allow mapping, display, and geographic analyses of the United States Postal Service (USPS) Zone Improvement Plan (ZIP) Codes dataset.

>ZIP Codes versus ZCTAs

>First introduced in 1963, ZIP Code is a trademark of the USPS created to coordinate mail handling and delivery. The USPS assigns ZIP Code ranges to regional post offices, which in turn assign ZIP Codes to delivery routes. Each delivery route is composed of street networks, and/or individual units with high mail volumes, such as high-rise buildings or individual business locations. ... The result is a point-based dataset unsuitable for mapping and many analysis applications.

>ZCTAs are generalized areal representations of the geographic extent and distribution of the point-based ZIP Codes built using 2020 Census tabulation blocks.
